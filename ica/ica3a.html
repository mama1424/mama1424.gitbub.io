                Dear Eileen,
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part 
                <br>of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

            <p>
                We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if 
                <br>you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
