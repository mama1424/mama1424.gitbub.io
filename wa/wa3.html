            <p>
                The <strong>2024 Summer Olympics</strong>, officially the <strong>Games of the XXXIII Olympiad</strong> and branded as <strong>Paris 2024</strong>, were an international multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.

                The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals. China tied with the United States on gold (40), but finished second due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall. This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in Summer Olympic history. Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing. At the conclusion of the games, despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the Games were considered a success by the press and observers.

        <!--Host Selection Section-->
        <div id = "HostSelection">
            <h2>Host Selection</h2>
            <p>Having previously hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, Paris did not attempt to host the Olympics again until it bid, unsuccessfully, for the 1992 Games which were awarded to Barcelona. Subsequent bids for the 2008 and 2012 Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded to Beijing and London, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to bid once more for the 2024 edition, which would mark the centenary of its last Games.</p>
            <p>The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest, Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, for the official U.S. bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the Games, partly because of mixed feelings among city residents. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum.[15] Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties.[16] Budapest withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum.</p>
            <p>Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes.[20][21] The International Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne.[21] The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028 and whether it was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time.[22]</p>
            <p>Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028,[23][24] enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017.[25]            </p>

            <h3>Host city election</h3>
            <p>Paris was elected as the host city on 13 September 2017 at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru. The two French IOC members, Guy Drut and Tony Estanguet, were ineligible to vote under the rules of the Olympic Charter.[26][27]</p>

            <h3>Venues</h3>
            <p>Most of the Olympic events were held in the city of Paris and its metropolitan region, including the neighbouring cities of Saint-Denis, Le Bourget, Nanterre, Versailles, and Vaires-sur-Marne.[28][29]</p>
            <p>The basketball preliminaries and handball finals were held in Lille, 225 km (140 mi) from the host city, Paris; the sailing and some of the football games were held in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, which is 777 km (483 mi) from Paris; meanwhile, the surfing events were held in Teahupo'o village in the overseas territory of Tahiti, French Polynesia, which is 15,716 km (9,765 mi) from Paris. Football was also hosted in an additional five cities: Bordeaux, Décines-Charpieu (Lyon), Nantes, Nice and Saint-Étienne, some of which are home to Ligue 1 clubs</p>

            <h3>Medals</h3>
            <p>The President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the Games engraved into it.[40] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[41]</p>
            <p>The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[42] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[43] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[44]</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[54] Brazil,[55] Canada (through the RCMP/OPP/CPS/SQ),[56][57][58] Cyprus,[59] the Czech Republic,[60] Denmark,[61] Estonia,[62][63] Finland,[64] Germany (through Bundespolizei[65][66]/NRW Police[67]),[68] India,[69][70] Ireland,[71] Italy,[72] Luxembourg,[73] Morocco,[74] Netherlands,[75] Norway,[57] Poland,[76] Portugal,[77] Slovakia,[78] South Korea,[79][80] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[81] Sweden,[82] the UAE,[83] the UK,[48] and the US (through the LAPD[84], LASD[85], NYPD[86], and the Fairfax County Police Department[87]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[88][89]</p>
            <p>Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[90][91][92] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[93]</p>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>Over €500 million has been invested in transport improvements for the Games,[109] with extensions to the Paris Métro and 60 kilometres (37 mi) of new cycle lanes.[110][111] Visitors to Paris will pay higher public transport fares during the Games, €4 instead of the previous €2.15 price. This will pay for the increased frequency and hours of service for public transport during the Games, with an average increase of 15% in services.[109][112] As with previous Games, 185 kilometres (115 mi) of reserved traffic lanes will be used to ensure reliable journey times for athletes, officials and the media.[113]</p>

            <h3>Volunteers</h3>
            <p>The Paris 2024 volunteer platform for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was opened to the public in March 2023. There were expected to be 45,000 volunteers recruited worldwide for the Games.[115] Following the end of registration on 3 May 2023, over 300,000 applications had been submitted to the Paris Organising Committee, exceeding the number of applicants for the previous two Olympics.[116] Applicants were notified of the outcome of their application between September and December 2023.[117] Over 800 applicants were excluded over security fears, among which 15 were flagged with Fiche S.[118]</p>

            <h3>Tickets</h3>
            <p>9.5 million of the 10 million tickets available for the games were sold. Several sports reported record attendance.[124]</p>

            <h2>The Games</h2>
            
            <h3>Opening ceremony</h3>
            <p>The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.[125] Directed by Thomas Jolly,[126][127][128] it was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural segments took place at various landmarks along the route.[129] Jolly stated that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of France, with an overall theme of love and "shared humanity".[129] The athletes then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of the Eiffel Tower.[130] Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others.[131]</p>
            <p>The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[132] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti [fr],[133] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem "La Marseillaise" atop the Grand Palais),[134] rapper Rim'K,[135] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[133] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[136]</p>
            <p>The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec, has a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere; it is allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron is not illuminated through combustion; the flames are simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.[137]</p>
            <p>Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was thought to parody the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[138] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[139][140]</p>

            <h3> Closing ceremony</h3>
            <p>The closing ceremony was held at Stade de France on 11 August 2024, and thus marked the first time in any Olympic edition since Sarajevo 1984 that opening and closing ceremonies were held in different locations (the same will happen again at Milano-Cortina 2026).[128] Titled "Records", the ceremony was themed around a dystopian future, where the Olympic Games have disappeared, and a group of aliens reinvent it. It featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and circus artists.[159] American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R. during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony.[160][161] The Antwerp Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his studio Fulwell 73.[162]</p>
        
            <h3>Participating National Olymic Committees</h3>
            <p>204 out of 206 National Olympic Committees are represented at the 2024 Summer Games with 54 from Africa, 48 from Europe, 44 from Asia, 41 from the Americas and 17 from Oceania. North Korea returned to the Games in 2024 after missing the 2020 edition. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IOC suspended the Olympic Committees of Russia and Belarus for violating the Olympic Truce. Russian and Belarusian athletes instead competed as "Individual Neutral Athletes" (AIN) without national identification,[163][164] as long as they did not "actively" support the war.[165][166] Individual neutral athletes had to be approved by each sport's international federation, and then the IOC's panel.[167] As individual athletes, AIN was not considered a delegation during the opening ceremony or in the medal tables.[168][169][170] The Refugee Olympic Team also competed.</p>
